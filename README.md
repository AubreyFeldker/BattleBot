## About
The section where I tell you all about the bot and myself!
### Bot
**BattleBot** was an idea that came about in November 2018 when I and the other staff at **1-Up World** were discussing future ideas for the server and how we could shake up the current Faction Battle formula. We came up with the idea for the now current *1-Up System*. In this new system, we decided to have a bot accompany it. 

**1-Up World** did have a custom bot before this, *1-Up Bot*, but it has been proven to have various performance issues. Not to mention that the creater and hoster of this bot had left the staff team about 2 months before this converstaion.

And in a matter of minutes, I was tasked with making a new bot from scratch, with help of course. **BattleBot** was officially created on November 5th, 2018. 2 months later, it was a reality and fully functional in the **1-Up World Discord server**, missing a few features of course but the basis was there.

I finished v1.0.0 of **BattleBot** on December 31st, 2018 and added it to **1-Up World** on January 1st, 2019. I've been updating it ever since, adding new features and commands, and from what I can tell, everyone seems to like how it turned out, including me.

### Me
#### (GitHub: Phoenix1128)
#### (Discord: Phoenix#0408)
Next we have me, **Phoenix**. I'm 15 and have been coding for around 4 years now. I've had a big interest in coding and computers since my 6th grade computer teacher, Mr. Scott, taught our class how to use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a program where you use blocks in order to learn the basics of coding and computer science.

That class changed everything. When I was young, I always wanted to be an author. All I would do was read and write in my free time. Of course I still played video games, soccer, and so on but what I really loved was writing and still do actually. That computer class though opened my eyes to a whole new world, the technological world.

After that, I started learning how to code on my own time. I started out learning the basics of *Javascript* and then moved on to dabble in *HTML* and *CSS* then moved onto to *C++* and *C#* and eventually circled back around to JS with **BattleBot**.

Nowadays, I'm working on **BattleBot** in my free time while also juggling high school, soccer, and family life. I'm a straight A student with a dream to go to MIT one day.

Now, my connection to **1-Up World**. I'm a Moderator on there and have been since September 2017. I've been part of the server since February 2017 and love the people there. Honestly, being a part of the community in general, not just being staff, is just amazing.

## I guess that's it
And I guess I'm done... until I add some other stuff in the future. Remember to join **1-Up World** at [discord.gg/mario](https://discord.gg/mario) and use `.help` in #robotic-operating-buddy!
