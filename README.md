## About
The section where I tell you all about the bot, myself, and 1-Up World!
### Bot
**BattleBot** was an idea that came about in November 2018 when I and the other staff at **1-Up World** were discussing future ideas for the server and how we could shake up the current Faction Battles, (more on that in the *1-Up World About* section). We came up with the idea for the now current *1-Up System*, (again, more on the later). In this new system, we decided to have a bot accompany it. 

**1-Up World** did have a custom bot before this, *1-Up Bot*, but it has been proven to be not suitable for our needs and had various performance issues. Not to mention that the creater and hoster of this bot had left the staff team about 2 weeks before this converstaion.

Several other staff members had offered to make the new bot but none of them had a means of hosting it. They could all code and work with **Node.JS** and **Discord.JS** and were very good at it, including myself to some degree but I'll talk more about that later.

And in a matter of minutes, I was tasked with making a new bot from scratch, with help of course. 2 months later, **BattleBot** was a reality and fully functional in the **1-Up World Discord server**, missing a few features of course but the basis was there.

I finished v1.0.0 of **BattleBot** on December 31st, 2018 and added it to **1-Up World** on January 1st, 2019. I've been updating it ever since, adding new features and commands, and from what I can tell, everyone seems to like how it turned out, including me.
