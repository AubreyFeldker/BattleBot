## About
The section where I tell you all about the bot and myself!
### Bot
**BattleBot** was an idea that came about in November 2018 when I and the other staff at **1-Up World** were discussing future ideas for the server and how we could shake up the current Faction Battles, (more on that in the *1-Up World About* section). We came up with the idea for the now current *1-Up System*, (again, more on the later). In this new system, we decided to have a bot accompany it. 

**1-Up World** did have a custom bot before this, *1-Up Bot*, but it has been proven to be not suitable for our needs and had various performance issues. Not to mention that the creater and hoster of this bot had left the staff team about 2 weeks before this converstaion.

Several other staff members had offered to make the new bot but none of them had a means of hosting it. They could all code and work with **Node.JS** and **Discord.JS** and were very good at it, including myself to some degree but I'll talk more about that later.

And in a matter of minutes, I was tasked with making a new bot from scratch, with help of course. **BattleBot** was officially created on November 5th, 2017. 2 months later, it was a reality and fully functional in the **1-Up World Discord server**, missing a few features of course but the basis was there.

I finished v1.0.0 of **BattleBot** on December 31st, 2018 and added it to **1-Up World** on January 1st, 2019. I've been updating it ever since, adding new features and commands, and from what I can tell, everyone seems to like how it turned out, including me.

### Me
#### (GitHub: Phoenix1128)
#### (Discord: Phoenix#0408)
Next we have me, **Phoenix**. I'm 15 and have been coding for around 4 years now. I've had a big interest in coding and computers since my 6th grade computer teacher, Mr. Scott, taught our class how to use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a program where you use blocks in order to learn the basics of coding and computer science.

That class changed everything. When I was young, I always wanted to be an author. All I would do was read and write in my free time. Of course I still played video games, soccer, and so on but what I really loved was writing and still do actually. That computer class though opened my eyes to a whole new world, the technological world.

After that, I started learning how to code on my own time. I started out learning the basics of *Javascrpit* and then moved on to dabble in *HTML* and *CSS* then moved onto to *C++* and eventually circled back around to JS with **BattleBot**.

Nowadays, I'm working on **BattleBot** in my free time while also juggling high school, soccer, and family life. I'm a straight A student with a dream to go to [MIT](https://mit.edu/) for college. I'm on the high school JV soccer team and was Captain of the Freshmen team this past year. My coach says I have a very good chance of making the Varsity team next year but we'll wait and see.

Now, my connection to **1-Up World**. I'm a Moderator on there and have been since September 2017. Although I have only been a part of the staff for a few months, i have actually been part of the server since February 2017. I love the people there and honestly, being a part of the community in general, not just being staff, is just amazing.

## I guess that's it
And I guess I'm done... until I add some other stuff in the future. Remember to join **1-Up World** at [discord.gg/mario](discord.gg/mario) and use `.help` in #robotic-operating-buddy!
